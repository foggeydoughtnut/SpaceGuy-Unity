# SpaceGuy
SpaceGuy is a top-down 2D game that I have been working on. Right now there is no story to it, but rather you just move around and shoot the enemies/bosses that are there. In each level there are upgrades and health potions to collect. There are two levels in total currently.  
  
The upgrades you can get right now include : A speed boost, health potion, a shotgun and a machine gun. Some upgrades only last for a few seconds while things like the shotgun and machine gun last until you die.  
  
The art is done by me except the basic enemy, the shooting enemy, and the dragon. The music I used was found here : https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/royalty-free-music/downloads-c/8-bit-music/6  
  
If you are interested I have the link to the google drive that contains the download of the build.
