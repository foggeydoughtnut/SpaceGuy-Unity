# SpaceGuy
SpaceGuy is a top-down 2D game that I have been working on. Right now there is no story to it, but rather you just move around and shoot the enemies/bosses that are there. In each level there are upgrades for your gun that you can get, and you lose them when you die. If you are interested I have the link to the google drive that contains the download of the build.
